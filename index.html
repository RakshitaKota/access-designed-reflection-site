            Access Designed <br>
            <span style="font-size: .8em; color: #000000aa;">Rakshita Kota's Reflection Site</span>
        </h2>

        <h3>Assessing My Efforts</h3>
        <p>In my group's project, I contributed to the development of key pages, including the careers and about us pages. I also took on part of the responsibility of enhancing accessibility across the website to ensure it was usable by all users. This involved manually adding accessibility features, such as alt text and other enhancements, to improve the experience for individuals with disabilities. I also played a significant role in addressing these accessibility concerns, especially since the theme we were using didn't have built-in accessibility features. Also, I was involved in selecting and incorporating photos into the pages, which added visual value to the design.</p>
        
        <h3>Ascertaining My Effects</h3>
        <p>I think my work made a big difference in the overall quality of the website, especially when it comes to accessibility. Plus, by quickly learning new tools and technologies, I was able to help my team get past some obstacles and keep the project moving forward.</p>
        <h4 style="color: #000000aa;">Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Adaptability: I quickly picked up new technical tools and applied them effectively, especially when we hit a roadblock with the theme. I figured out the correct process for implementing changes, which helped us move forward.</p></li>
            <li><p>Collaboration: I maintained strong communication with my team, contributing to a cooperative environment where everyone pulled their weight.</p></li>
            <li><p>Accessibility Focus: My commitment to making the website accessible to all users was a key strength, ensuring inclusivity for everyone who interacts with the site.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 style="color: #000000aa;">Weaknesses</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><p>CSS Editing: I wish I had more experience with editing CSS. This is something I can improve on for future projects, and I know that the more I practice, the more comfortable I'll become with it.</p></li>
            <li><p>Time Management: I think we could have gotten off to a faster start. Although we were always on track, starting earlier would have helped alleviate some of the stress we felt at later stages.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Appreciating your experience.</h3>
        <p>This experience has been a valuable learning opportunity. I've had the chance to deepen my technical skills, especially in accessibility, which will be beneficial for future projects. Working with a real client also gave me insight into how to navigate client relationships and manage feedback. I've also improved my problem-solving skills, particularly when we encountered unexpected technical challenges.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, I realize the importance of starting projects early to avoid the stress of rushing at the end. I've learned how to pick up new technical tools quickly, and this skill will be useful in future projects. My ability to collaborate effectively with my team and contribute to different aspects of the project will also continue to be an important skill.</p>

        <h3>Reflection on What Accessibility Can Do</h3>
        <p>Accessibility is vital because it ensures that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can access and engage with content. For a website, accessibility features like alt text for images, screen reader compatibility, and keyboard navigation options make a huge difference for users with visual impairments, motor disabilities, or other challenges. Adding accessible design elements, not only makes the site usable for more people, but also helps create an ethical and inclusive platform. Accessibility ensures that all users have equal opportunities to engage with digital content, which is especially important for a nonprofit organization that aims to serve as many people as possible.</p>
